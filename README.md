#1 PPC-builder

This is the wordpress Plugin that creates POST with given template based on the excel data uploaded.
In admin page, you can upload the data needed to create post, such as Logo, Ad image and excel file.
The sample excel file included.
As the tempate is made for the asks of my client, if you want to use on your side, you should change the template name and field name to get.
To change this, you should have knowledge about Wordpress backend, template, plugin.
Thanks.
